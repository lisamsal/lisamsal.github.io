      In 2015, the NYC Comptroller’s office released a report stating that about 30 percent of schools in NYC do not have a designated space for physical education, and that one in three schools have no full-time certified PE teachers.

      <p class="blurbtwo">
        When this report was made public, nearly 80 percent of students in District 6 were receiving less than the required amount of PE Instruction. Since then, the average percentage has gone down significantly––numbers for 2018 are in the 16–32 percente range.

  Although there have been improvements, there are still students who are not receiving an adequate amount of PE time, which can have an impact on their physical and mental health. Fe Florimon, chair of the Youth and Education Board for Community District 12, said that students who know the importance of physical health will less likely become obese and depressed.
